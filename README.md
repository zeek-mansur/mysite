# My Personal online CV & Portfolio 

This is my personal website created for educational purpose, consisting of my resume and portfolio. It lists my skills and projects, and contains links for my GitHub, Twitter, LinkedIn and Instagram profiles.

There is also a contact form for recruiters, other coders or customers to get in touch with me if they want to hire me or collaborate.

## UX

My website is for recruiters, other coders and potential customers, who are looking to hire a web developer or collaborate.  

I've chosen to keep my website in the way that I have, as I felt it will be easy for users to navigate without getting lost. The dark colour scheme and fonts that I've chosen usually transmit a sense of mystery and elegance. The colour scheme also reflect less light which also makes it easier for users to read.
 
### User Stories

- As a recruiter, I want to navigate through a prospect page as easy as possible in order to save time.
- As a recruiter, I would like to have a link to download the prospect CV so that I can make contact when needed. 
- As a recruiter, I want to be able to get back to the home page quickly and easily, so I don't get lost navigating. 
- As a customer, I would like an online form to get in touch with the individual that I need to hire. 
- As a customer/recruiter I would like to see links to the individual's different social media profiles, so I can learn more about the person.
- As a recruiter, I would like to see the portfolio well arranged on the webpage so  i can view the work of the prospect.

 
### Wireframes

Wireframes were drawn using Balsamiq. Two wireframes can be seen for some pages in order to consider how to make my website responsive. The links to the files are below:

- [index.html (xs and sm)](https://github.com/zeek-mansur/web-page-repo/blob/master/wireframes/New%20Wireframe%207.png)

- [contact.html (lg and xl)](https://github.com/zeek-mansur/web-page-repo/blob/master/wireframes/New%20Wireframe%206.png)

There is a little difference between some pages on my wireframes and my final website. This was due to visual preferences and feedback received from other users.
